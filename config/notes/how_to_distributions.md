- `normal` (Gaussian): symmetric “bell curve” (measurement noise, heights-ish).
- `lgnormal`: positive-only, right-skewed (income, file sizes, durations).
- `exponential`: positive-only, many small values, few large (time between events in simple processes).
- `gamma`: positive-only, flexible right-skew (lifetimes, waiting times, reliability).
- `uniform`: flat across a range (random sampling, some synthetic features).
- `beta`: bounded in [0,1] (rates, proportions, probabilities).
- `student`: like normal but heavier tails (robust modeling).
- `pareto`: very heavy tail (wealth, followers, city sizes).
- `multimodal`: multiple peaks (e.g., heights of adults + children together).
